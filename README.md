## Hi there 👋

I'm mayedl10, a student at the [Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt](https://www.aau.at/) studying applied computer science (bachelor).

I enjoy working on interesting projects, though most of them don't end up here on GitHub :P

I usually write my programs in C++ or Python, but I am open to trying new things!

My biggest project is probably [BFIL](https://www.github.com/mayedl10/bfil), but my simple [math expression evaluator](https://github.com/Mayedl10/math-expression-evaluator/) better represents my current coding abilities.
